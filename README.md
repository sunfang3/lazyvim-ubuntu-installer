## Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

-   Ubuntu 22.04 (headless or server image)
-   Internet connection

## Usage

1. Run the following command to execute the system setup script:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsmith165/lazyvim-ubuntu-installer/main/ubuntu_setup.sh | bash
```

2. Set the VNC password:

```
x11vnc -storepasswd
```

3. Start the VNC server:

```
~/.vnc/xstartup &
```

4. Open a VNC session using the IP address and port provided by the script, and enter the user-defined password.

5. Once connected to the VNC session, everything should be set up and ready to use

6. To open the Alacritty terminal use one of the following options:

    - During setup we created a desktop icon, if you see it on the gnome-desktop, double click it.
    - Alternatively you can run `ctrl + alt + t` to open the default ubuntu terminal. In the terminal run `alacritty`.

7. To open LazyVim run:

```
nvim
```
