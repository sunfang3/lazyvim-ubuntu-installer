# Ubuntu System Setup and LazyVim Installation

![LazyVim Logo](assets/lazyvim-ubuntu-installer-logo.png)

This project provides a comprehensive system setup script (`system_setup.sh`) to automate the installation and configuration of a GUI environment from a headless Ubuntu 22.04 image, along with a script (`setup.js`) that handles the installation of LazyVim (Neovim config) and various development tools.

## Features

-   Installs and configures a desktop GUI (GNOME) on a headless Ubuntu 22.04 image
-   Sets up VNC server (x11vnc) for remote access to the GUI environment
-   Installs and configures Alacritty terminal emulator with Fira Code Nerd Font
-   Installs Node.js, Yarn, and Bun for modern JavaScript development
-   Installs and configures Visual Studio Code with essential extensions
-   Installs and sets up LazyVim (Neovim config) with LSPs, plugins, and custom keybinds
-   Configures devicons for enhanced visual file type recognition in Neovim

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

-   Ubuntu 22.04 (headless or server image)
-   Internet connection

## Setup Script Steps

1. Update package lists and install essential packages
2. Install and configure the desktop GUI (GNOME)

4. Install and configure Alacritty terminal emulator with Fira Code Nerd Font
5. Install Git, Node.js, Yarn, and Bun
6. Install and configure Visual Studio Code with essential extensions
7. Clone and configure the LazyVim repository
8. Install and configure LSPs for Python and TypeScript/JavaScript
9. Configure additional plugins like Harpoon, Tagbar, and Surround
10. Set up custom keybinds for plugins and generic Vim/Tmux/Linux usage

## Usage

1. Run the following command to execute the system setup script:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsmith165/lazyvim-ubuntu-installer/main/system_setup.sh | bash
```

2. Set the VNC password:

```
x11vnc -storepasswd ~/.vnc/passwd
```

3. Start the VNC server:

```
~/.vnc/xstartup &
```

4. Open a VNC session using the IP address and port provided by the script, and enter the user-defined password.

5. Open the Alacritty terminal emulator.

6. Create a directory for setup and navigate to it:

```
mkdir -p /root/dev/setup/;cd /root/dev/setup/
```

7. Clone the LazyVim Ubuntu Installer repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tsmith165/lazyvim-ubuntu-installer.git
```

8. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```
cd lazyvim-ubuntu-installer
```

9. Run the LazyVim installation script:

```
./install.sh
```

## Customization

If you want to customize the LazyVim configuration, you can modify the files in the `~/.config/nvim` directory.

For information on the custom keybinds and plugins, refer to the following files:
